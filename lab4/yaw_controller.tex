To the global variables defined in Listing~\ref{lst:global}, we added the following variables for the yaw controller:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C, caption={Global variables for yaw control}, label={lst:global_yaw}]
float e_num,e_den,e_sl; // line tracking error
float psi_err; // yaw error
float V, w_1, w_2; // speed reference after the controller yaw
float kp_yaw = 7; // proportional gain for yaw control
float yaw_rate; 
float lambda[8]; // distance between the sensors and the center of the sensor array
\end{lstlisting}

As for the previous approach, inside the \texttt{HAL\_TIM\_PeriodElapsedCallback(TIM\_HandleTypeDef *htim)} function, we read the status of the line sensors and saved it in an array, see Listing~\ref{lst:sens_line}.
And we used it to compute the line tracking error $e_{SL}$, as shown in Listing~\ref{lst:line_tracking_error}, where we resorted to Equation (\ref{eq:lambda_n}), (\ref{eq:e_sl}) and (\ref{eq:psi_err}).
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C, caption={Line tracking error}, label={lst:line_tracking_error}]
e_num = e_den = 0;

for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
    lambda[i] = ((N-1)/2 - i)*P; // distance between sensor n and the center
    e_num += active_pins[i]*lambda[i]; // distance between sensor n and the center
    e_den += active_pins[i];
}
if(e_den == 0)
    e_sl = 0;
else
    e_sl = e_num / e_den;

psi_err = e_sl / H;
\end{lstlisting}

The yaw rate is calculated as a proportional term of the psi error as shown in Listing~\ref{lst:yaw_control}, which is then used to adjust the wheel speeds accordingly.
Indeed, we computed the desired wheel speeds $w_1$ and $w_2$ based on the reference speed and the yaw rate, using Equation~(\ref{eq:omega}), where the reference speed was set to 30 RPM.
Next, we used them to compute the speed error for each motor: \texttt{speed\_error = w\_1 - TIM3\_speed;} for motor 1 and \texttt{speed\_error2 = w\_2 - TIM4\_speed;} for motor 2.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C, caption={Yaw control law}, label={lst:yaw_control}]
yaw_rate = kp_yaw * psi_err; 
V = (reference_speed*RPM2RADS)*r; //RADS
w_1 = ((V + yaw_rate*(D/2))/r)*RADS2RPM; // Right wheel speed
w_2 = ((V - yaw_rate*(D/2))/r)*RADS2RPM; // Left wheel speed
\end{lstlisting}

From now on, the code for the speed control of each motor is the same as in the previous approach, see Listing~\ref{lst:speed_control}.
