In this laboratory activity, we successfully implemented a line-following algorithm for the TurtleBot using a combination of low-level and high-level control strategies. 
The low-level controllers ensured precise wheel speed control, but the trajectory was not smooth, since the robot tended to oscillate around the line. 
To address this, we introduced a high-level yaw controller that adjusted the robot's heading based on the line tracking error. 
This approach significantly improved the robot's ability to follow the line smoothly and accurately. 
The results demonstrated that the yaw controller effectively minimized the yaw error, allowing the robot to maintain a stable trajectory.

We believe that further improvements can be made by tuning the controller parameters and increasing the velocities, which would allow the robot to follow the line more quickly while maintaining stability.
